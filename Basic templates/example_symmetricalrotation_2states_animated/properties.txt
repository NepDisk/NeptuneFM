	"name": "example",
	"name_explanation": "The name of your follower. The names of followers appear on the main menu, upon toggling \"extrainfo mode\" with the drift button. For character names with spaces, use underscores instead of spaces: underscores will be interpreted as spaces in-game, while spaces won't work.",
	"prefix": "EXMP",
	"prefix_explanation": "A set of 4 characters used to internally identify your follower, mainly used for its files.",
	"category": "Fanworks",
	"category_explanation": "The category your follower will appear under. Followermaker doesn't allow for the creation of custom categories, though you can still enter one.",

	"prefcolor": "red",
	"prefcolor_explanation": "Default follower color. Must use the name of a spray can, as seen on the main menu in extrainfo mode.",

	"scale_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Scale relative to the player's. Value entered will be inserted as [value] * FRACUNIT",
	"scale_divide": 1,
	"scale_divide_explanation": "The value that the follower's scale will be divided by. Value entered will be inserted as [scale] * FRACUNIT / [scale_divide]. Combine with scale to make fractionary scales such as 2/5 (e.g. scale is set to 2 and scale_divide is set to 5), most useful for hi-res sprites.",
	"bubblescale": 0,
	"bubblescale_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Bubble scale relative to the player scale. If not set, no bubble will spawn.",
	"atangle": 230,
	"atangle_explanation": "Angle the follower will be at around the player. The follower will always face the same direction as the player.",
	"distance": 40,
	"distance_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Distance relative to the player (in a circle).",
	"height": 32,
	"height_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Height of the follower, this is mostly important for Z-flipping.",
	"zoffs": 32,
	"zoffs_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Z-offset relative to the player's height. Cannot be negative.",
	"horzlag": 3,
	"horzlag_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Lag for X/Y displacement. Must be > 0 because we divide by this number.",
	"vertlag": 6,
	"verlag_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Lag for Z displacement. Must be > 0 because we divide by this number.",

	"bobamp": 4,
	"bobamp_explanation": "(in Fracunits) Bob amplitude.",

	"bobspeed_explanation": "(in Tics) Arbitrary modifier for bobbing speed. Default is TICRATE*2 (70 Tics = 2 seconds)",

	"following_animation_speed_explanation": "(in Tics) Number of Tics it takes to cycle through an animated sprite in the following state.",
	
	
	"follower_states_help": "As you may know, followers have several animations for things that can occur during the race; these are described as \"states\". Followers can have up to 7 states, in order: an idle state, a following state (as in, following the player), a hurt state (when you get hit by an item), a lose state (when you lose the race), a win state (win the race), a \"hit confirm\" state (occurs when you hit another racer with an item), and a \"ring\" state (used whenever Auto Ring is enabled as the follower spends your rings). Of these, the idle state is obligatory in all followers.",

	"template_explanation": "This specific template is designed for followers with an idle and following state, with 2-frame animations for each state and 5 unique degrees of rotation. The second, third, and fourth rotation sprites are duplicated and mirrored, thus this template assumes a follower of symmetrical appearance.",
