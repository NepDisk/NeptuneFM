	"name": "example",
	"name_explanation": "The name of your follower. The names of followers appear on the main menu, upon toggling \"extrainfo mode\" with the drift button. For character names with spaces, use underscores instead of spaces: underscores will be interpreted as spaces in-game, while spaces won't work.",

	"scale_divide_explanation": "The value that the follower's scale will be divided by. Value entered will be inserted as [scale] * FRACUNIT / [scale_divide]. Combine with scale to make fractionary scales such as 2/5 (e.g. scale is set to 2 and scale_divide is set to 5), most useful for hi-res sprites.",

	"follower_states_help": "As you may know, followers have several animations for things that can occur during the race; these are described as \"states\". Followers can have up to 7 states, in order: an idle state, a following state (as in, following the player), a hurt state (when you get hit by an item), a lose state (when you lose the race), a win state (win the race), a \"hit confirm\" state (occurs when you hit another racer with an item) Additionally, the duration of the hit confirm state is controlled by a variable which can be edited above.",

	"template_explanation": "This specific template is designed for followers with all seven states a follower can have. The idle and following states support 2-frame animations with 5 unique degrees of rotation, with the second, third, and fourth rotation sprites being duplicated and mirrored. The hurt, lose, win, hit confirm, and ring states support a 2-frame sprite that is seen from any angle.",
