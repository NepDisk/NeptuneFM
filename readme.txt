Followermaker, created by Superstarxalien based on Kartmaker

HOW TO USE:
- Copy one of the example/ folders and rename it (your WAD will be named after this folder)
- Edit the top of "properties.txt" to set various properties for your follower, and adjust the RGB colors that the
  converter considers transparent pixels if you want
- Create or paste your follower's sprites into the template provided
- Replace the sound file in the folder with the OGG sound that you want your follower to have (this program does not convert
  or add echo for you)
- Drag the folder onto followermaker.exe, or run followermaker.exe and pass the folder as an argument
- The WAD will be placed next to your follower's source folder, ready to play

Ignore build.bat and the src/ folder for standard use. This is a compile script and source files. You can use it if you
want to modify the program (you need GCC installed). I make no guarantees that the program compiles on other setups.
