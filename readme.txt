NeptuneFM by NepDisk, based on original Followermaker created by Superstarxalien which was based on Kartmaker
r5

HOW TO USE:
- Copy one of the example/ folders and rename it (your WAD will be named after this folder)
- Edit values in "properties.txt" to set various properties for your follower, and adjust the RGB colors that the
  converter considers transparent pixels if you want
- Each editable field in properties.txt comes with additional information on its use
- Create or paste your follower's sprites into the template provided
- Drag the folder onto NeptuneFM.exe, or run NeptuneFM.exe and pass the folder as an argument
- The WAD will be placed next to your follower's source folder, ready to play

The main goal of NeptuneFM is to allow for base-level creation of followers. It is not a comprehensive program, and as
such you may still need to use SLADE in order to make full use of the features that follower creation provides.

Huge thanks to casual koopa for creating the advanced template images as well as the instructions for those, and tips on
general aspects of the program.
